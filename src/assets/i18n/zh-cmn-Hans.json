  "HOME": "主页",
  "HOME_CARD_CHALLENGE": "While Keystone Adventures programs are designed to be accessible to participants with no previous experience, they are also intended to be challenging.\n\nParticipants can expect to push themselves physically in order to overcome these challenges. In achieving success, students will gain personal confidence and self-esteem and become open to wider opportunities and life chances.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_ABOUT": "Keystone Adventures is a pioneer in the field of experiential education in China. With extensive experience and deep relationships, we are proud to offer programs in more than a dozen provinces in China, as well as in other locations throughout Asia. Compared to other providers, we offer the broadest array of activities and greatest variety in programming.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_ACCOMMODATION": "For many programs, we are able to offer a range of accommodation options, which might range from 4-star hotels, to family-run guesthouses, to camping in tents. All accommodation options must meet our rigorous standards of safety, hygiene, and comfort, and must be large enough to accommodate big groups. (This is always verified through pre-trip site visits). Typically, 2-3 students will share one room, while accompanying teachers will get their own rooms. Beyond that, we are happy to tailor accommodation options to the needs and budgets of our clients.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_BACKUP_PLANS": "As many of our programs and activities take place outside, there is always the possibility of disruption, due to inclement weather, air pollution, etc. Keystone Adventures has developed comprehensive contingency plans, which enable us to make quick changes to activities. In addition, every program has access to a comprehensive “rainy-day kit,” filled with schematics for indoor activities. In short, while we _hope for the best_ in all of our programs, we are also _prepared for the worst_.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_EMERGENCY_PROCEDURES": "All Keystone Adventures staff are familiar with emergency procedures for each program/activity sites. Planning covers arrangements if the trip needs to be cancelled or recalled (due to severe weather conditions, natural disaster, etc.). In the event of an evacuation, the general manager of Keystone Adventures, key administrators from client school, and parents (if necessary/applicable) will be notified immediately.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_EQUIPMENT": "Keystone Adventures maintains a warehouse filled with proprietary gear for our programs and expeditions, covering rock climbing, camping, cycling, kayaking, cultural activities, and more. This enables us to maximize safety and optimize the logistics for our programs, and minimizes the need to rely on third-party providers.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_INSURANCE": "_Keystone Adventures_ is contractually obligated to provide adequate cover for medical expenses, personal injury and death, and local transportation. We ensure that insurance covers all activities, such as for trekking, cycling, kayaking, and high ropes activities, as applicable. Of course, these policies do NOT cover against loss of baggage and loss/theft/damage to personal property, and curtailment or cancellation of trip, and participants may consider taking out additional coverage.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_MEALS": "Most of our programs take place in China and are aimed at students that live in China. Accordingly, sit-down meals on our programs are typically taken family-style and consist of local cuisine. Of course, we understand that participants have their own limitations and expectations regarding food, and we make an effort to cater to everyone. We do this by varying both dishes and restaurants throughout the trip, offering the option of DIY and/or western meals in suitable locations, and arrange for local cooking activities where appropriate.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_MISSION": "Keystone Adventures’ goal is to complement the traditional classroom style of teaching with authentic EOTC experiences. All of our programs focus on encouraging students to grow through engagement, leadership, and teamwork. Our programs are tailored to participants’ age and ability level. By providing a supportive atmosphere, our guides aim to push students and inspire confidence in otherwise challenging outdoor environments.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_RISK_MANAGEMENT": "Keystone Adventures completes risk assessments on our programs, taking not only safety into account, but availability of quality food and water, distance to emergency medical care, evacuation procedures, quality of transportation, etc. The risk assessments are updated before every single program, and we are happy to share these with clients upon request.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_SAFETY_FIRST_AID": "In designing our programs, selecting locations, and hiring staff, safety is our greatest priority. Towards that end, all Keystone Adventures staff-members receive training in wilderness first-aid, risk management, and child protection, and carry fully-stocked first aid kits at all times. Finally, we have a comprehensive child safeguarding policy and a manual of Standard Operating Procedures, which are happy to share with schools.  Ultimately, our impeccable safety record is a point of pride for our company, and we will continue to work diligently to ensure that it remains unblemished.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_STAFF": "KA guarantees a student-to-facilitator ratio of at least 1:10 on all of our programs. Our instructors hail from countries around the world, including China, the United States, Canada, Australia, and others. They boast decades of combined guiding experience, spanning some of the world’s great wilderness areas. Most of our staff are bi-lingual (English and Chinese) and are comfortable facilitating in both languages.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_TRANSPORTATION": "Buses for all programs are chartered through licensed transportation companies. In our contracts with them, Keystone Adventures insists on high standards of safety and cleanliness. All buses must be equipped with seat-belts, drivers must be criminally vetted, and buses should be cleaned daily. In the event of a sub-standard experience, arrangements will be made immediately for a change in bus/driver.",
  "HOME_CARD_LOCATIONS": "Due to extensive experience and deep relationships within the industry, we are proud to offer programs in more than a dozen domestic provinces, as well as in a handful of countries in greater Asia and the rest of the world.",
  "HOME_CARD_OUR_GOAL": "Keystone’s goal is to complement the traditional classroom style of teaching with real outdoor adventure experience.\n\n**All of our programs** focus on encouraging students to grow through cooperation, teamwork and positive leadership.",
  "HOME_CARD_RISK_MANAGEMENT": "In designing our programs, selecting locations, and hiring staff, safety is our greatest priority.\n\nKeystone Adventures completes risk assessments on our programs, taking not only safety into account, but availability of quality food and water, distance to emergency medical care, evacuation procedures, quality of transportation, etc.",
  "HOME_CARD_STAFF": "The Keystone Adventures team is full of energetic, motivated people who are passionate about what they do. Our leaders are paramount to the success of our expeditions and are fully committed to delivering a quality and safe experience.\n\nStaff are expected to have a college degree, have the desire and ability to teach and work in the outdoors, be self-motivated, flexible and patient.",
