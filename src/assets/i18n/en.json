  "HOME": "Home",
  "HOME_CARD_CHALLENGE": "While Keystone Adventures programs are designed to be accessible to participants with no previous experience, they are also intended to be challenging.\n\nParticipants can expect to push themselves physically in order to overcome these challenges. In achieving success, students will gain personal confidence and self-esteem and become open to wider opportunities and life chances.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_ABOUT": "Keystone Adventures is a pioneer in the field of experiential education in China. For more than 10 years, we have worked with some of the most prestigious international schools in Asia to deliver innovative and meaningful programming for students. With extensive experience and deep relationships, we are proud to offer programs in more 30 locations around China, as well as in other locations throughout Asia. Compared to other providers, we offer the broadest array of activities and greatest variety in programming.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_ACCOMMODATION": "For many programs, we are able to offer a range of accommodation options, ranging from 4-star hotels, to family-run guesthouses, to camping in tents. All accommodation options must meet our rigorous standards of safety and hygiene, and must be large enough to accommodate big groups. Typically, 2-3 students will share one room, while accompanying teachers are allocated private rooms. Beyond that, we are happy to tailor accommodation options to the needs and budgets of our clients.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_BACKUP_PLANS": "As many of our programs and activities take place outside, there is always the possibility of disruption, due to inclement weather, air pollution, etc. Keystone Adventures has developed comprehensive contingency plans, which enable us to make quick changes to activities. In addition, all programs receive a comprehensive “rainy-day kit,” filled with materials for indoor activities. While we hope for the best in all of our programs, we are also prepared for the worst.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_EMERGENCY_PROCEDURES": "All Keystone Adventures staff must be familiar with emergency procedures for each program/activity site. Our planning covers arrangements that would need to take place if the trip needs to be cancelled or recalled (due to severe weather conditions, natural disaster, etc.). In the event of an evacuation, the general manager of Keystone Adventures, key administrators from client school, and parents (if necessary/applicable) will be notified immediately.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_EQUIPMENT": "Keystone Adventures maintains a warehouse filled with gear for our programs and expeditions, covering rock climbing, camping, cycling, kayaking, cultural activities, and more. Gear is procured from reputable vendors, and is certified by international organizations, where applicable. This enables us to maximize safety and optimize the logistics for our programs, and minimizes the need to rely on third-parties to source equipment.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_INSURANCE": "_Keystone Adventures_ is contractually obligated to provide adequate cover for medical expenses, personal injury and death, and local transportation. We ensure that insurance covers all activities, such as for trekking, cycling, kayaking, and high ropes activities, as applicable. Of course, these policies do NOT cover against loss of baggage and loss/theft/damage to personal property, and curtailment or cancellation of trip; participants may consider taking out additional coverage.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_MEALS": "Most of our programs take place in China and are aimed at students that live in China. Accordingly, sit-down meals on our programs are typically taken family-style and consist of local cuisine. We also understand that participants have their own limitations regarding food, and we make an effort to cater to everyone. We vary restaurants and dishes throughout the trip, offer DIY and/or western meals in suitable locations, and arrange for local cooking activities where appropriate.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_MISSION": "Keystone Adventures’ goal is to complement the traditional classroom style of teaching with authentic EOTC experiences. All of our programs focus on encouraging students to grow through engagement, leadership, and teamwork. Our programs are tailored to participants’ age and ability level. By providing a supportive atmosphere, our guides aim to push students and inspire confidence in otherwise challenging outdoor environments.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_RISK_MANAGEMENT": "Keystone Adventures completes risk assessments for all programs, taking not only safety into account, but food and water hygiene, distance to emergency medical care, evacuation procedures, quality of transportation, etc. Our proprietary risk management protocols ensure that risk is kept at levels which are considered acceptable and manageable. The risk assessments are updated before every single program, and we are happy to share these with clients upon request.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_SAFETY_FIRST_AID": "In designing our programs, selecting locations, and hiring staff, safety is our greatest priority. We have developed a comprehensive child safeguarding policy and Standard Operating Procedures. Our staff receive extensive training in these areas, as well in wilderness first-aid and risk management.  Ultimately, our impeccable safety record is a point of pride for our company, and we will continue to work diligently to ensure that it remains unblemished.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_STAFF": "KA guarantees a student-to-facilitator ratio of at least 1:10 on all of our programs. Our instructors hail from countries around the world, including China, the United States, Canada, Australia, and others. They boast decades of combined guiding experience, spanning some of the world’s great wilderness areas. Most of our staff are bi-lingual (English and Chinese) and are comfortable facilitating in both languages.",
  "HOME_CARD_CONTENT_TRANSPORTATION": "Buses for all programs are chartered through licensed transportation companies. In our contracts with them, Keystone Adventures insists on high standards of safety and cleanliness. All busses must be equipped with seat-belts, drivers must be criminally vetted, and buses should be cleaned daily. In the event of a sub-standard experience, arrangements will be made immediately for a change in bus/driver, with minimal disruption to the program.",
  "HOME_CARD_LOCATIONS": "Due to extensive experience and deep relationships within the industry, we are proud to offer programs in more than a dozen domestic provinces, as well as in a handful of countries in greater Asia and the rest of the world.",
  "HOME_CARD_OUR_GOAL": "Keystone’s goal is to complement the traditional classroom style of teaching with real outdoor adventure experience.\n\n**All of our programs** focus on encouraging students to grow through cooperation, teamwork and positive leadership.",
  "HOME_CARD_RISK_MANAGEMENT": "In designing our programs, selecting locations, and hiring staff, safety is our greatest priority.\n\nKeystone Adventures completes risk assessments on our programs, taking not only safety into account, but availability of quality food and water, distance to emergency medical care, evacuation procedures, quality of transportation, etc.",
  "HOME_CARD_STAFF": "Our staff are the lifeblood of our organization, and we guarantee a student-to-facilitator ratio of at least 1:10 on all of our programs. Our instructors hail from countries around the world, including China, the United States, Canada, Australia, Spain, and others. They boast decades of combined guiding experience, spanning some of the world’s great wilderness areas.
