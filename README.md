# KeystoneRegistration

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

To generate a new component in its own module with routing, for example, a module called hello-world:

1. ng g module pages/hello-world --routing
2. ng g component pages/payments --module=hello-world

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Regular expressions can be used to only run some tests from the command line, for example `ng test --include='**/home.component.spec.ts'` to only run the _home component's_ tests. More complex commands are also possible, for example `ng test --include='src/app/pages/*/{faq,home}.component.spec.ts'` to test the _faq_ and _home_ components. [source here][1].

`ng test --no-watch` to only run the tests once and return to the command line prompt.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
